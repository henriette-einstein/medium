**Charles III**, known prior to his accession as **Prince Charles**, became the King of the [[United Kingdom]] and the other Commonwealth realms following the passing of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on September 8, 2022. Born on November 14, 1948, Charles Philip Arthur George is the eldest child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His early life was marked by a royal education and various public duties, attending schools like Gordonstoun and the University of Cambridge, and serving in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.

Before becoming king, Charles was the Prince of Wales, a title he held from 1958 until he ascended the throne, making him the longest-serving Prince of Wales in British history. Throughout his time as Prince of Wales, Charles was known for his commitment to various social and environmental causes. He has been an outspoken advocate on issues including climate change, architecture, and urban planning, and has established numerous charitable organizations and initiatives.

Charles III's accession to the throne marked the beginning of a new era in the British monarchy. He has expressed intentions to modernize and streamline aspects of the monarchy, reflecting contemporary values and societal changes. His reign is anticipated to focus on continuing the legacy of public service and charitable work, with a keen emphasis on addressing global challenges like climate change and conservation.

King Charles III's personal life has also been a subject of public interest, including his marriages to Lady Diana Spencer, with whom he had two sons, Princes William and Harry, and Camilla Parker Bowles, who became the Queen Consort upon his accession. His relationship with Diana, their subsequent divorce, and her tragic death in 1997 were highly publicized and had a significant impact on public perceptions of the royal family.

Charles III's reign represents a continuation of the British monarchy's evolution, reflecting both tradition and the need for adaptation in a rapidly changing world.
