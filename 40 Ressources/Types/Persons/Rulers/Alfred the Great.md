**Alfred the Great** (849â€“899 AD) was a King of Wessex from 871 to 899. He is one of England's most celebrated monarchs, known for his scholarly nature and for defending his kingdom against [[Vikings|Viking]] invasions, effectively laying the groundwork for a unified English nation. Alfred is the only English king to be accorded the epithet "the Great," a testament to his leadership, military prowess, and contributions to education and legal reform.

Alfred was not only a warrior king, but also a learned man who believed in the importance of education. He promoted the use of English rather than Latin, which made education more accessible to the common people. He also initiated the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]], a collection of documents that are crucial sources of early English history.

Alfred's military innovations were significant; he reorganized the Anglo-Saxon armies and developed a network of fortified towns, known as burhs, across his kingdom. These fortifications were critical in protecting his realm from [[Vikings|Viking]] raids and invasions.

In addition to his military and educational reforms, Alfred translated several Latin books into Old English, aiming to improve the literacy and knowledge of his people. His translations included works of history and philosophy, reflecting his desire to bring learning and wisdom to his subjects.
