**Charlemagne**, also known as **Charles the Great**, was a medieval emperor who ruled much of Western Europe from 768 to 814. He was born around April 2, 747, into the Carolingian dynasty, a family that would come to dominate Frankish nobility. Charlemagne's reign is marked by a series of military conquests, through which he expanded the Frankish realm and established his empire as the most powerful in Europe since the fall of the [[Roman Empire]].

Upon the death of his father, [[Pepin the Short]], in 768, Charlemagne inherited the Kingdom of the Franks jointly with his brother Carloman. However, Carloman's death in 771 left Charlemagne as the sole ruler. Over the next few decades, Charlemagne embarked on a mission to unite all Germanic peoples into a single kingdom and convert his subjects to Christianity. His conquests included areas of present-day France, [[Germany]], Italy, Austria, and the Low Countries. He also fought campaigns in Spain and against the Avars in Central Europe.

Charlemagne's crowning achievement came on Christmas Day in the year 800, when he was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III in Rome. This act revived the concept of the Roman Empire in the West and established the [[Carolingian Empire]], which was later termed the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a key institution in European history that lasted until 1806.

Aside from his military successes, Charlemagne is remembered for his contributions to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], a revival of art, religion, and culture through the auspices of the church. He established a court school led by the scholar Alcuin of York, where education and the arts flourished. Charlemagne's reforms extended to the standardization of Christian worship, the introduction of the Carolingian minuscule script, which improved literacy, and the implementation of administrative reforms throughout his empire.

Charlemagne died on January 28, 814, in Aachen, in modern-day Germany. He was buried in what is now Aachen Cathedral. Charlemagne's legacy is vast; he is often called the "Father of Europe" for uniting much of Western Europe for the first time since the Roman Empire and for laying the foundations for the modern states of Germany and France.
