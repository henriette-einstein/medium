**Louis the Pious**, also known as **Louis I**, was the King of the Franks and Emperor of the [[Carolingian Empire]] after the death of his father, [[Charlemagne]]. Born on April 16, 778, Louis was the third son of Charlemagne and his wife Hildegard. He became the sole emperor of the Carolingian Empire in 814, following his father's death.

Louis's reign is characterized by his attempts to maintain the unity of the empire, a task that proved to be increasingly difficult due to internal conflicts, especially among his sons. He inherited an empire that spanned most of Western Europe, and he sought to govern it with a focus on the Christian faith and the Church's teachings, earning him the nickname "the Pious."

In 817, Louis issued the Ordinatio Imperii, an ordinance designed to secure the succession and the unity of the empire after his death. However, this plan led to civil wars among his sons, [[Louis the German]], [[Charles the Bald]], and [[Lothar]], each of whom desired a larger share of the territory. These conflicts weakened the empire and foreshadowed its eventual division.

Louis was deposed twice, once in 830 and again in 833, largely due to the machinations of his sons and their supporters, but he was restored to the throne on both occasions. His reign saw the continuation of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]], a revival of art, culture, and learning initiated by his father, although the internal divisions and conflicts marked a decline from the heights of Charlemagne's era.

Louis the Pious died on June 20, 840, and his death precipitated the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, which divided the Carolingian Empire among his three surviving sons. This division laid the groundwork for the modern states of France and [[Germany]]. Louis's reign, despite its challenges, is noted for its contributions to the legal and administrative organization of the empire and its promotion of a Christian moral order.
