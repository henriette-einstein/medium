![[Medieval Period.webp]]

The **Medieval Period**, often referred to as the **Middle Ages**, spans roughly from the 5th to the late 15th century, marking the period in European history from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the beginning of the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. This era is traditionally broken down into three subperiods: the [[Early Middle Ages]] (c. 500–1000), the [[High Middle Ages]] (c. 1000–1300), and the [[Late Middle Ages]] (c. 1300–1500).

**Early Middle Ages:** Characterized by the decline of classical learning and the spread of Christianity and Islam, this period saw the emergence of [[Feudalism|feudalism]], where society was structured around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service and labor. The Early Middle Ages were marked by the migration and settlement of barbarian peoples and the establishment of new kingdoms on the ruins of the Roman Empire.

**High Middle Ages:** This period witnessed a significant population increase in Europe, along with advances in agriculture, trade, and economy that led to the development of towns and cities. The High Middle Ages were also notable for the Crusades, a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period, and the flourishing of medieval culture and philosophy, particularly scholasticism.

**Late Middle Ages:** The Late Middle Ages were a time of social, political, and economic upheaval, characterized by the Black Death, which killed an estimated one-third of Europe's population, the Hundred Years' War between England and France, and the rise of strong centralized monarchies. This period also saw the early stirrings of the [[Renaissance]], as interest in classical learning and values began to re-emerge, leading to significant cultural, scientific, and technological advances.
