A **Historical Age** is a more specific subdivision of a [[Historical Era]], typically focusing on a shorter period of time within a larger historical context. 
Ages are often defined by 
- specific events, 
- movements, or 
- cultural phenomena 
that are particularly characteristic of that period.

## Examples
The Viking Age, the Age of Exploration, and the Victorian Age are examples of historical ages within broader historical eras. Each of these ages represents a distinct period of time with its own unique characteristics and significance.
