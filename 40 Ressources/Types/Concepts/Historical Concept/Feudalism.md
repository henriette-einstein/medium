Feudalism is a socio-political and economic system that dominated medieval Europe, especially from the 9th to the 15th centuries, though its origins can be traced to earlier periods and its practices varied significantly over time and between regions. The system emerged in response to the need for order and security following the collapse of the [[Roman Empire]] and the subsequent increase in external invasions and internal conflicts. Feudalism is characterized by a set of legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around three key concepts: lords, vassals, and fiefs.

## Key Features of Feudalism

**1. Lords and Vassals:**
At the heart of feudalism is the relationship between **lords** (landowners or nobles) and **vassals** (lesser nobles who received protection and land from a lord). Lords granted a portion of their land or resources (fiefs) to vassals in exchange for military service and loyalty. This hierarchical system created a network of relationships that structured medieval society.

**2. Fiefs:**
A fief was land granted by a lord to a vassal in exchange for military service and other duties. The possession of land was central to the feudal system, as land was the primary source of wealth and the basis for agricultural production. Fiefs could range from entire regions to single farms.

**3. Homage and Fealty:**
The relationship between a lord and his vassal was formalized through ceremonies of homage and fealty. The vassal would swear loyalty to the lord, promising to provide military service, advice, and financial or judicial support as needed. In return, the lord offered protection and the right to exploit the land and its resources.

**4. Manorial System:**
The economic foundation of feudalism was the manorial system, where the lords' estates (manors) were the primary units of production. Serfs and peasants worked the land, providing agricultural produce to the lord in exchange for protection and the right to cultivate plots for their own use.

**5. Military Obligations:**
Feudal society was militarized, with vassals required to provide a certain number of knights or soldiers for the lord's service. This military system was essential for defense, the enforcement of authority, and the prosecution of conflicts.

**6. Decentralized Authority:**
Feudalism was characterized by a decentralized political structure where local lords exercised significant autonomy, often acting as the primary judicial and administrative authority within their fiefs. The king or central ruler had limited direct control over distant territories, relying instead on the loyalty and military support of his vassals.

## Impact and Decline

Feudalism played a crucial role in shaping medieval society, influencing the development of legal and political institutions. However, the system began to decline in the late medieval period due to several factors, including the growth of trade and cities, the centralization of royal power, changes in military technology, and social transformations such as the Black Death. The transition away from feudalism laid the groundwork for the development of modern state systems and capitalist economies.
