The **Treaty of Verdun**, signed in 843, was an agreement that marked the **division of the [[Carolingian Empire]] into three separate kingdoms**. This treaty is a significant event in European history, as it laid the foundation for the future political and territorial developments on the continent.

1. **Background:**
   - The Carolingian Empire, founded by [[Charlemagne]], had become the largest European empire since the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. After Charlemagne's death in 814, his empire was ruled by his grandsons, Charles the Bald, Lothair I, and Louis the German. Disagreements and conflicts arose among these rulers over the division of the empire.

2. **Division of the Empire:**
   - The Treaty of Verdun, negotiated in the city of Verdun-sur-Meuse in 843, resulted in the division of the Carolingian Empire into three main regions:
     - The [[West Frankish Kingdom]] (later known as the Kingdom of France) was allocated to Charles the Bald.
     - The [[Middle Frankish Kingdom]] (Lotharingia) was granted to Lothair I. This region included parts of present-day Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and northeastern France.
     - The [[East Frankish Kingdom]] (later becoming the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) was assigned to Louis the German. It covered much of modern-day Germany and parts of neighboring territories.

3. **Lothair's Role:**
   - Lothair I, who received Lotharingia, was given the title of "Emperor" in the treaty, signifying a nominal overlordship over his two brothers' realms. However, his position was largely symbolic, as real power resided with the individual rulers of each kingdom.

4. **Long-Term Impact:**
   - The Treaty of Verdun is considered one of the earliest examples of the fragmentation of a once-unified empire into distinct kingdoms. This division laid the groundwork for the development of modern European nation-states, with France, Germany, and the Low Countries (Belgium and the Netherlands) emerging from the remnants of the Carolingian Empire.

5. **Feudalization and Regional Autonomy:**
   - The division of the empire contributed to the rise of regionalism and feudalism, as local nobles gained more authority within their territories. It marked the beginning of a period of decentralization, where local lords and rulers had greater autonomy over their domains.
