The 9th century was a period of significant developments in trade and economics that contributed to the growth of cities, the expansion of trade networks, and the increased sophistication of economic practices across various regions of the world. These developments were driven by political stability in certain areas, technological advancements, and the expansion of trade routes. Here are some of the key movements regarding trade and economics during the 9th century:

## Expansion of Trade Networks

1. **Viking Trade and Exploration:**
   - Vikings played a crucial role in opening new trade routes across the Atlantic, into the Mediterranean, through the rivers of Eastern Europe, and even reaching the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Their trading outposts and settlements, such as those in Novgorod and Dublin, became important centers for the exchange of goods, including furs, slaves, silver, and weapons.

2. **The Silk Road and the Islamic Golden Age:**
   - Under the Abbasid Caliphate, the Islamic world experienced a golden age of science, culture, and commerce. Baghdad became a key center for trade, drawing merchants from across the Eurasian continent. The Silk Road facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and technology between the East and West, with Islamic traders playing a pivotal role in the trade of silk, spices, precious metals, and other luxury goods.

3. **Trade in the Carolingian Empire:**
   - The [[Carolingian Empire]], under [[40 Ressources/Types/Persons/Rulers/Charlemagne]] and his successors, saw improvements in agricultural productivity and the revival of long-distance trade in Western Europe. The use of rivers for trade and the establishment of market towns and fairs contributed to the economic revival of Europe. Charlemagne's efforts to standardize weights and measures and to reform the currency also facilitated trade.

## Technological and Agricultural Developments

1. **Agricultural Innovations:**
   - The 9th century saw the adoption of the heavy plough in Northern Europe, which significantly increased agricultural productivity by making it possible to cultivate the heavy, fertile soils of river valleys. This, along with the use of new horse collars that improved ploughing efficiency, contributed to population growth and urbanization.

2. **Advancements in Shipbuilding:**
   - The Vikings' advancements in shipbuilding, including the design of the longship, enabled not only raiding but also more efficient trade and exploration. These ships were highly maneuverable and capable of navigating both open seas and shallow rivers, expanding the Vikings' trade reach.

## Monetary Systems and Economic Practices

1. **Development of Silver Economies:**
   - The influx of silver from the Islamic world, particularly as payment for slaves and other goods from the Viking and Slavic territories, led to the increased use of silver as currency in Europe. This facilitated the growth of market economies and the expansion of trade.

2. **The Use of Promissory Notes in the Islamic World:**
   - In the Islamic world, especially in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the development of financial instruments like promissory notes (sakk, which is the root of the modern word "cheque") and letters of credit facilitated long-distance trade by reducing the need to carry large amounts of currency on dangerous trade routes.

## Conclusion

The 9th century marked a period of significant economic and trade developments that laid the groundwork for the High Middle Ages' commercial revolution. These movements were characterized by the expansion of trade networks, technological and agricultural innovations, and the evolution of economic practices that enhanced the efficiency of trade and contributed to the economic prosperity of various regions.
