The Vikings, originating from Scandinavia (modern-day Norway, Denmark, and Sweden), were not only fierce warriors but also traders, explorers, and settlers. The 9th century marks a significant period in Viking history known as the Viking Age, which lasted from the late 8th century to the mid-11th century. This era was characterized by extensive raiding, colonizing, conquest, and trading throughout Europe and even reaching parts of North America. Here are some key aspects of the Vikings during the 9th century:

1. **Raiding and Warfare**: The Vikings are perhaps best known for their raids across Europe. Their sleek, fast longships allowed them to strike quickly and unexpectedly along coasts and rivers. In 793, the raid on [[Lindisfarne]] marked the beginning of the [[Viking Age]]. Throughout the 9th century, they continued their raids across Europe, including France, England, Scotland, Ireland, and parts of Southern Europe.

2. **Settlements**: Beyond raiding, Vikings also established settlements in many territories they explored or conquered. Notably in this period:
   - They founded Dublin in Ireland in 841.
   - They began settling in Iceland around mid-century.
   - In England, following several decades of raids and battles with local kingdoms (notably under leaders like Alfred the Great), Vikings began to settle more permanently as part of various peace agreements.

3. **Exploration**: Vikings were renowned seafarers who ventured beyond their Scandinavian homelands to explore vast areas of Europe, Russia (via its rivers), North Africa, and even reached North America (Vinland) around 1000 AD (slightly after this period but indicative of their seafaring prowess). The discovery of Iceland and Greenland occurred around this period.

4. **Society & Culture**: Viking society was organized into a relatively hierarchical structure with kings and jarls (nobles) at the top down to thralls (slaves) at the bottom. They practiced a pagan religion worshipping gods such as Odin and Thor before gradually converting to Christianity towards the end of the Viking Age.

5. **Impact on Europe**: The presence of Vikings led to significant changes in European politics and society:
   - Their raids prompted improvements in European defensive strategies and fortifications.
   - They played a crucial role in developing trade networks between different parts of Europe.
   - Viking settlements contributed to cultural exchanges between Scandinavian and other European cultures.
   - The establishment of Danelaw in England by Danish Vikings influenced English law.

6. **Kievan Rus**: One significant aspect outside Scandinavia was Rurik's establishment foundation for Kievan Rus' around 862 which would later evolve into Russia and Ukraine; demonstrating how Viking influence extended deep into Eastern Europe.

The 9th century represents a critical phase where Vikings left an indelible mark on European history through their conquests but also through less often highlighted aspects like trade relations that shaped medieval European development.
