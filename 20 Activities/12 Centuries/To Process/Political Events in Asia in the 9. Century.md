The 9th century saw significant political developments in Asia, with profound changes and the emergence of influential states and empires that shaped the region's history. Southeast Asia, in particular, experienced critical transformations during this period, with the rise and fall of kingdoms and the spread of cultural and religious influences from India and China. Here's an overview of important political developments in Asia and specifically Southeast Asia during the 9th century:

## Central and East Asia

1. **The Tang Dynasty in China (618-907):**
   - The Tang Dynasty, although approaching its decline by the 9th century, continued to influence the political and cultural landscape of East Asia. The An Lushan Rebellion (755-763) significantly weakened the dynasty, leading to increased regional autonomy and the rise of warlordism. Despite these challenges, the Tang Dynasty maintained a significant cultural and economic influence across Asia through the Silk Road and its tributary system.

2. **The Tibetan Empire:**
   - The Tibetan Empire, having reached its height in the 7th and 8th centuries, began to decline in the 9th century due to internal strife and fragmentation. However, it remained a significant political and military force in Central Asia. The period saw the spread of Buddhism within Tibet, influencing the region's religious and cultural development.

## South Asia

1. **The Pala Empire in Bengal:**
   - The Pala Empire, which emerged in the 8th century, continued to dominate much of the northeastern Indian subcontinent during the 9th century. Known for its patronage of Buddhism, the Pala Empire played a crucial role in the cultural and intellectual life of the region, establishing significant educational institutions like the Vikramashila University.

2. **The Pratihara and Rashtrakuta Empires:**
   - The 9th century in India was marked by the tripartite struggle for control of the northern Indian subcontinent, involving the Pratihara, Rashtrakuta, and Pala dynasties. The Rashtrakutas, centered in the Deccan Plateau, were particularly noted for their contributions to art and architecture, as seen in the rock-cut Kailasa Temple at Ellora.

## Southeast Asia

1. **The Srivijaya Empire:**
   - Srivijaya, a powerful maritime and trading empire based on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, reached its peak in the 9th century. It controlled the strategic Strait of Malacca, dominating sea routes between India and China and facilitating the spread of Mahayana Buddhism throughout the region. Srivijaya's influence extended over the Malay Archipelago and parts of the Thai-Malay Peninsula.

2. **The Sailendra and Mataram Kingdoms in Java:**
   - In Java, the Sailendra dynasty, known for its patronage of Mahayana Buddhism, constructed the monumental Borobudur temple during the early 9th century. Meanwhile, the Mataram Kingdom, associated with the Sanjaya dynasty, emerged as a significant political and religious center in central Java, with Hinduism and Buddhism coexisting and influencing Javanese culture.

3. **The Khmer Empire (Angkor):**
   - Although the [[Khmer Empire]] is often associated with the 12th century and the construction of [[Angkor Wat]], its foundations were laid in the 9th century under King Jayavarman II, who established a unified state and declared independence from Java. This period marked the beginning of the Khmer Empire's rise as a major power in mainland Southeast Asia, with [[Hinduism]] and later [[Buddhism]] shaping its religious and cultural landscape.

## Conclusion

The 9th century was a period of dynamic political developments in Asia, with the emergence of empires and states that played critical roles in regional and international trade, religious transformations, and cultural exchanges. In Southeast Asia, the period was marked by the rise of maritime empires like Srivijaya, significant architectural and religious developments in Java, and the early stages of the Khmer Empire, setting the stage for the region's historical trajectory in the centuries to follow.
