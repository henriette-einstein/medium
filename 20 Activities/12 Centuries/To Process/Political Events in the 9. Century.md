The 9th century was characterized by several crucial political developments that had a lasting impact on the medieval world. These developments shaped the political landscape of Europe, Asia, and beyond, laying the groundwork for future states and conflicts. Here are some of the most significant political developments of the 9th century:

1. **The Carolingian Empire's Expansion and Fragmentation:**
   - The reign of [[Charlemagne]] (768-814) marked the peak of the [[Carolingian Empire]]'s power, with significant territorial expansion across Western Europe. Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Romans by Pope Leo III in 800, signifying a renewal of the Roman Empire in the West and the close relationship between the Frankish state and the Church.
   - After Charlemagne's death, the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) divided the empire among his grandsons, leading to the fragmentation of Carolingian power. This division laid the foundations for the development of modern France and Germany and marked the beginning of [[Feudalism]] as a dominant social structure in Europe.

2. **The Rise of the Abbasid Caliphate:**
   - The Abbasid Revolution in 750 led to the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate and the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate, which moved the Islamic Empire's capital from Damascus to Baghdad. This shift marked a golden age of Islamic culture and science, with the Abbasids adopting a more inclusive policy towards non-Arab Muslims.
   - The Abbasid Caliphate saw internal strife and the rise of autonomous dynasties, which gradually diminished the central authority of the caliphs. Notably, the establishment of the Samanid, Tulunid, and Fatimid dynasties in different regions indicated the fragmentation of Abbasid control.

3. **The Viking Expeditions and Settlements:**
   - Viking raids and expeditions from Scandinavia began in the late 8th century and continued throughout the 9th century. Vikings explored, raided, and settled in various parts of Europe, including the British Isles, France (leading to the establishment of Normandy), and parts of the Russian and Byzantine Empires.
   - The Vikings established the Danelaw in England, a significant political development that influenced English politics and culture. They also founded the Kingdom of Dublin, marking one of the earliest Norse settlements in Ireland.

4. **The Byzantine Empire's Struggles and Recovery:**
   - The 9th century was a period of both challenge and revival for the Byzantine Empire. The empire faced external threats from the Arabs and internal strife, including iconoclasm, which was a dispute over the use of religious images.
   - The Macedonian dynasty, established in the late 9th century, initiated a period of recovery and expansion that would continue into the next century. The dynasty's policies strengthened the empire's military, economy, and administrative systems.

5. **The Formation and Expansion of the Bulgarian Empire:**
   - The recognition of the Bulgarian Empire by the Byzantine Empire in 681 after years of warfare marked the establishment of Bulgaria as a significant power in Southeastern Europe.
   - The conversion of Boris I to Christianity and the formal adoption of Christianity as the state religion in 864 strengthened the central authority and cultural unity of Bulgaria. This move also had significant political implications, aligning Bulgaria more closely with the Christian states of Europe and away from the influence of the Byzantine and Eastern Orthodox Churches.

These developments highlight the dynamic and transformative nature of the 9th century, as political entities expanded, evolved, or emerged anew, setting the stage for the complex medieval tapestry of Europe and the Islamic world.
