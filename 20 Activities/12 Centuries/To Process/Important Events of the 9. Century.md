### Important Events

1. **The Carolingian Renaissance (Late 8th to 9th Century):** A period of cultural and intellectual revival in the Carolingian Empire under the reign of [[Charlemagne]] and his successors. This renaissance emphasized the importance of education, leading to the preservation of classical literature and the development of a more legible script known as Carolingian minuscule.
2. **[[The Viking Age]] (Late 8th to the mid-11th Century):** Vikings from Scandinavia embarked on raids, trade, and settlement throughout Europe, reaching as far as North America. Their impact was profound, leading to changes in the political landscape of Europe and the establishment of settlements that would grow into modern cities.
3. **The Foundation of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750 AD):** Although the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate occurred in the late 8th century, the Abbasid Caliphate's influence peaked in the 9th century. The period is known for its significant contributions to science, culture, and the arts, particularly during the reign of Harun al-Rashid and his successors.
4. **The Formation of [[Feudalism]] in Europe:** The 9th century saw the roots of feudalism begin to take hold in Europe, a system that would dominate the Middle Ages. This was partly in response to the need for protection against frequent Viking, Magyar, and Saracen raids.
