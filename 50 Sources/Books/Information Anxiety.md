## Summary
"Information Anxiety" by [[Richard Saul Wurman]] is a classic publication that addresses the overwhelming flood of information that people face in the modern world. First published in 1989, the book delves into the issue of information overload, a phenomenon that has only intensified with the advent of digital technology and the Internet. Wurman, an architect and graphic designer by training, is also the founder of the TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conferences, and his interest in the accessibility and organization of information shines through in this book.

The core argument of "Information Anxiety" is that the sheer volume of information available is not in itself beneficial; rather, it's the ability to understand, process, and make use of this information that is crucial. Wurman identifies a gap between the information we have access to and our capacity to comprehend it, leading to anxiety and a sense of being overwhelmed.

Wurman proposes several strategies for managing information and reducing anxiety. These include 
- improving information design and architecture to make data more accessible and understandable, 
- honing personal skills in information management, such as critical thinking and the ability to focus on what's truly important, and 
- embracing a more question-driven approach to learning and discovery, which encourages more profound understanding rather than superficial knowledge accumulation.

"Information Anxiety" is not just a critique but also offers an approach to tackling the challenges posed by the information age. It emphasizes the importance of context, relevance, and the human dimension in the design and dissemination of information.
